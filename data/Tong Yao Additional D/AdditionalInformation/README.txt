Regarding the data rows – the two / four final columns will be the channels for counting. The  spreadsheet "Edinburgh cycle counter info - current.xls" has information about which direction these are counting (EB = eastbound, etc).
 
Re. Portobello Promenade – this has four channels because it is very wide and the loops can only measure across a 3m width max. With the Promenade being so wide we installed two loops – one next to each gap in a line of bollards restricting access. Unfortunately the gate between the bollards was opened and most cyclists went through there instead!
 
Unfortunately the dmp files are the rawest form of the data we get. You would need to speak to the manufacturer to establish if it is possible to get ‘event’ data but this is almost certainly not being stored at present.
 
A member of my team is currently working on a revised counter location plan and I will forward this to you when completed.
 
We are just about to start public consultation on Roseburn – Leith Walk (until Xmas). Data collected / analysed in the next few months could be of use although it should be noted that any major changes to the design are unlikely to be possible without requiring further consultation and delay to the project.
