# Project Explanation

We try to use Edinburgh Cycling Data to do our group work, the data structure is as the followings:
* counter_id: the data is collected via labelled automatic counter (1-48);
* date: the day on which the data was collected (18/03/2010);
* time: the data is collected on an hourly-basis (0~23);
* channel_1: the direction of travel (north-bound);
* channel_2: the direction of travel (south-bound)


We try to focus on human behaviour and analyze the cycling data with other databases:
* cycling & weather
* cycling & altitude
* cycling & date & time
